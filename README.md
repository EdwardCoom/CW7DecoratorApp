# CW7: Recognizing Patterns and Decorator Practice

Name: Zach Coomer

Date: 2/15/2023

## Description

A console application made from decorator.dia UML and added a decorator as listed from UpdateZCdecorator.dia UML. This is a rough program to show decorator pattern in use.

## Challenges

* Learing how to call parent constructor for child constructor took some digging.

## Design Decisions

Everything is kept in a single Program.cs file, due to simplicity of code. 

## Files Required

* Program.cs 
	- All of the code necessary to run is located in this file.

* README.md
	- Here I list brief information about the program and topics related to the program.

## How to Run

This program is currently intended to be run in Visual Studios 2022, console application.

## Notes

* Both Dia files have been uploaded to this repository for reference. The original given file is decorator.dia, and the updated file is UpdatedZCdecorator.dia.
